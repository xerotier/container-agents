# Xerotier XIM Agent — macOS app

A native SwiftUI app — the macOS deployment of the Xerotier agent: a one-window
**installer + environment-prep + control surface** that wraps the downloaded
`xerotier-xim-agent` release binary. It presents both a **menu bar
item** (status + quick start/stop) and a **full window**. Everything runs as
the logged-in user — no admin password.

> **Status: real engine.** The install pipeline, service control, preflight,
> release download, and log streaming are implemented natively (see the
> `Sources/XerotierAgent/Engine/` layer) — a Swift port of the shell script.
> On launch the app inspects the host and reflects any existing install.

## Run it

From this directory (`macos/app`):

```bash
swift run
```

or open `Package.swift` in Xcode and press Run. Requires the Xcode/Swift
toolchain (built and verified with Swift 6.2 on macOS). Minimum deployment
target: macOS 14.

## What it does

1. **Setup** — live host preflight (arm64 / macOS 15+ / curl / uv), then paste a
   join key and **Install & Start**. The pipeline runs for real: provision
   Python 3.12 via uv → install vllm-metal → download
   `xerotier-xim-agent-Darwin-arm64` from releases → install the HF shim →
   render the wrapper/entrypoint/plist → `launchctl bootstrap`.
2. **Dashboard** — live service tiles plus Start / Stop / Restart / Uninstall
   (driven by `launchctl`).
3. **Logs** — `tail -F` of `~/Library/Logs/xerotier/xim-agent.{out,err}.log`,
   with stream filter, auto-scroll, and clear.
4. **Settings** — the full `XEROTIER_AGENT_*` surface; **Apply & Restart**
   re-renders the plist and reloads the agent.
5. **Menu bar** — the bolt icon shows status; the popover gives quick controls
   and an **Open Xerotier…** action.

## Packaging

Build a distributable `.app` and DMG from `packaging/`:

```bash
# Ad-hoc signed (local/dev) — no Apple Developer ID needed:
./packaging/build-app.sh            # → dist/Xerotier.app
./packaging/make-dmg.sh             # → dist/Xerotier-<version>.dmg

# Signed + notarized (for distribution):
CODESIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: … (TEAMID)" \
  VERSION=0.1.0 ./packaging/build-app.sh
NOTARY_PROFILE=xerotier-notary VERSION=0.1.0 ./packaging/make-dmg.sh
```

- `build-app.sh` builds the release binary, assembles the bundle from
  `packaging/Info.plist` (bundle id `com.xerotier.agent`, min macOS 14), and
  signs (hardened runtime + timestamp when a real identity is given).
- The **app icon** is rasterized crisply from `packaging/xerotier-favicon.svg`
  (the official mark) via `make-icon.sh` → `make-icon.swift`, with the
  background themed to the Xerotier warm cream `#FFF5EE` (override with
  `ICON_BG`).
- `make-dmg.sh` builds a drag-to-Applications DMG and, when `NOTARY_PROFILE`
  (a stored `notarytool store-credentials` profile) is set, notarizes + staples.
- `.github/workflows/macos-app.yml` runs the same scripts in CI (ad-hoc by
  default; uncomment the signing block + add secrets for notarized releases).
- `dist/` is git-ignored.

## Notes

- **LaunchAgent** is managed via `launchctl` against a plist written to
  `~/Library/LaunchAgents`, because the plist is rendered dynamically with the
  join key and absolute paths. `SMAppService` is the App-Store-friendly
  alternative once the plist can be bundled.
- **Templates** (`entrypoint`, vLLM wrapper, HF shim) are embedded in
  `Templates.swift` so the app is self-contained and is the source of truth for
  the rendered artifacts.
- **Accelerator readout** is live from Metal (`MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice`,
  `recommendedMaxWorkingSetSize`).
